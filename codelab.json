  "summary": "This workshop provides an overview of the latest research on HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS), an attack abusing inconsistencies between the interpretation of requestsâ€™ ending by HTTP request parsers. The attack occurs when, for the same stream, the proxy component sees one request while the web backend component sees another requests. The most common risks will be presented, along with a set of payload variations and a live attack demonstration.",
